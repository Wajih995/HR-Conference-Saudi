# Stripe Payment URL Updated ✅

## Update Applied

The Stripe payment link has been updated to the **correct URL** you provided.

### Old URL (Incorrect):
```
https://buy.stripe.com/6oUcN5e1I5oadnG8ww
```

### New URL (Correct): ✅
```
https://buy.stripe.com/6oUcN5e1I5oadnG8954c81d
```

## Files Updated

### 1. `components/layout/NominationModal.tsx` (Line 121)
The main payment redirect function now uses the correct URL.

### 2. `STRIPE_SETUP.md`
- Updated payment link reference (2 locations)
- Instructions now point to correct URL

### 3. `NOMINATION_SYSTEM_README.md`
- Payment link section updated

### 4. `QUICK_START.md`
- Stripe configuration section updated

## What This Means

When users click **"Pay to Continue"** in the nomination form:
- They will be redirected to: `https://buy.stripe.com/6oUcN5e1I5oadnG8954c81d`
- This is the correct Stripe payment checkout page
- After payment, they'll return to the awards page (if success URL is configured)

## Next Steps

### Important: Configure Success URL in Stripe Dashboard

Since you're using a Stripe Payment Link, you need to configure where users should be redirected after successful payment:

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Navigate to **Payment Links**
3. Find and click on your payment link: `https://buy.stripe.com/6oUcN5e1I5oadnG8954c81d`
4. In the **"After payment"** section, set the success URL to:
   - **For testing:** `http://localhost:3001/awards?payment=success`
   - **For production:** `https://yourdomain.com/awards?payment=success`
5. **Save** the changes

### Why This Matters

The `?payment=success` parameter tells the website:
- To detect that payment was completed
- To reload the form data from localStorage
- To show the confirmation screen
- To allow the user to submit their nomination

## Testing

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/awards
2. Click **"Submit Nomination"**
3. Fill out the form
4. Click **"Pay to Continue"**
5. You should now be redirected to the **correct Stripe checkout page**
6. Complete test payment (use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`)
7. After payment, verify you're redirected back to `/awards`

## Verification

You can verify the URL is correct by checking:

```bash
# In the browser developer console after clicking "Pay to Continue":
console.log(window.location.href)
# Should show: https://buy.stripe.com/6oUcN5e1I5oadnG8954c81d
```
