# Nomination Flow Updated - New Simplified Process

## ✅ Changes Made

The nomination system has been updated to a **simpler, one-step process**.

---

## 🔄 Old Flow (REMOVED)
1. User fills form
2. Clicks "Pay to Continue"
3. Form saved to localStorage
4. Redirect to Stripe payment page
5. After payment, redirect back to website
6. Modal reopens with pre-filled data
7. User confirms and submits
8. Email sent

**Problems with old flow:**
- Required Stripe Dashboard configuration for redirect URL
- Complex localStorage management
- Payment had to complete before email was sent
- User could get stuck if redirect failed

---

## 🆕 New Flow (CURRENT)
1. User fills out the nomination form
2. Clicks **"Submit & Pay"** button
3. **Both actions happen simultaneously:**
   - ✅ Form data is sent via email to `Yasir@theboredroomx.com`
   - ✅ Stripe payment page opens in a **new tab**
4. User completes payment in the new tab
5. Modal closes automatically after 2 seconds

**Benefits of new flow:**
- ✅ Simpler user experience
- ✅ No Stripe redirect configuration needed
- ✅ Email sent immediately (payment happens separately)
- ✅ No localStorage complexity
- ✅ No risk of losing form data
- ✅ User can complete payment at their own pace in new tab
