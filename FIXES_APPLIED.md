# Fixes Applied to Nomination System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Stripe Payment "Something Went Wrong" Error

**Problem:**
The Stripe payment link was being called with query parameters, which Payment Links don't accept.

**Solution:**
- Removed query parameters from Stripe URL
- Simplified redirect to: `https://buy.stripe.com/6oUcN5e1I5oadnG8ww`
- Created `STRIPE_SETUP.md` with instructions to configure success URL in Stripe Dashboard

**Action Required:**
You must configure the success URL in your Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Payment Links
2. Find your payment link
3. Set success URL to: `http://localhost:3001/awards?payment=success` (for testing)
4. For production: `https://yourdomain.com/awards?payment=success`

### 2. ✅ Form Fields Don't Match Google Form

**Problem:**
The form had generic fields that didn't match the Google Form structure.

**Solution:**
Updated form to include all fields from the Google Form:

#### Nominator Information:
- Full Name ✅
- Email Address ✅
- Phone Number ✅
- Company ✅ (NEW)
- Job Title ✅ (NEW)

#### Nominee Information:
- Full Name ✅
- Email Address ✅
- Phone Number ✅
- Company ✅ (NEW)
- Job Title ✅ (NEW)

#### Nomination Details:
- Category of Nomination (dropdown with 20 categories) ✅
- Reason for Nomination (textarea) ✅
- Supporting Documents (file upload, optional) ✅

**Total Fields:** 13 (up from 9)
