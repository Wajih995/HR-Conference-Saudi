4. ‚ùå No console logging to debug issues

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Frontend**

**File:** `components/layout/NominationModal.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added detailed console logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Explicitly construct nomination data object
- ‚úÖ Parse and display API error messages
- ‚úÖ Better error messages for users
- ‚úÖ Log request and response data

**Updated Code:**
```typescript
const handleSubmitAndPay = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    // Prepare data explicitly
    const nominationData = {
        nominatorFullName: formData.nominatorFullName,
        nominatorEmail: formData.nominatorEmail,
        // ... all fields
        nomineeProfilePicture: formData.nomineeProfilePicture?.name || 'None',
        nomineeProject: formData.nomineeProject?.name || 'None'
    }

    console.log('Submitting nomination data:', nominationData)
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/submit-nomination', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(nominationData)
    })
    
    const result = await response.json()
    console.log('API Response:', result)
    
    // Show detailed error if available
    if (!response.ok) {
        setSubmitMessage(result.error || 'Error submitting nomination.')
    }
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling in Backend**

**File:** `app/api/submit-nomination/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive console logging
- ‚úÖ Validate environment variables before use
- ‚úÖ Log each step of the email sending process
- ‚úÖ Return detailed error messages
- ‚úÖ Better error tracking

**Updated Code:**
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
    try {
        console.log('=== Nomination API called ===')
        
        const body = await request.json()
        console.log('Request body received:', body)
        
        // Validate environment variables
        if (!process.env.EMAIL_USER || !process.env.EMAIL_PASS) {
            return NextResponse.json({ 
                error: 'Email service not configured.' 
            }, { status: 500 })
        }
        
        console.log('Creating email transporter...')
        // Create transporter...
        console.log('Email transporter created successfully')
        
        console.log('Sending email to:', 'Yasir@theboredroomx.com')
        await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)
        console.log('Email sent successfully!')
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('=== Error submitting nomination ===')
        console.error('Error details:', error)
        
        return NextResponse.json({ 
            error: errorMessage,
            details: error.message
        }, { status: 500 })
    }
}
```

## üìé About File Attachments

### Important Note:
The current system **does NOT upload actual files**. Here's why:

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ File names are captured from the uploaded files
- ‚úÖ File names are sent in the email
- ‚ùå Actual file content is NOT uploaded to server
- ‚ùå Files are NOT attached to emails

**Why:**
1. **File uploads require different handling** - Can't send files as JSON
2. **Email attachments have size limits** - Gmail SMTP has 25MB limit
3. **Security concerns** - File uploads need validation, virus scanning
4. **Storage needed** - Files need to be stored somewhere accessible

**What's Sent in Email:**
```

Project File: policy-pol_68e4fefac67ede88c3865f09.pdf
```

## üîß To Enable Actual File Uploads (Optional)

If you want to actually upload and send files, here's what needs to be done:

### Option 1: Send File Names Only (Current - RECOMMENDED)
- ‚úÖ **Already implemented**
- User can send files separately via email
- Simpler, faster, more reliable
- No storage needed

### Option 2: Upload Files to Server & Attach to Email
- Need to use `FormData` instead of JSON
- Store files temporarily on server
- Attach files to email
- Delete files after email sent
- **Complex implementation**

### Option 3: Upload to Cloud Storage
- Upload files to AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.
- Send download links in email
- Most scalable solution
- **Requires external service**

**Recommendation:** Keep current implementation (file names only) unless you specifically need file uploads.

## üß™ How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
Submitting nomination data: { ... }
API Response: { ... }
```

### Step 2: Check Server Terminal
Look for logs in the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`:
```
=== Nomination API called ===
Request body received: { ... }
Creating email transporter...
Email transporter created successfully
Sending email to: Yasir@theboredroomx.com
Email sent successfully!
```

### Step 3: Common Errors & Solutions

#### Error: "Email service not configured"
**Cause:** Missing environment variables
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check .env.local file exists
Get-Content .env.local

# Should show:
EMAIL_USER=wajih.rizvi1995@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=xalewkuoonuwjxve

# If missing, restart dev server:
npm run dev
```

#### Error: "Invalid login" or "Authentication failed"
**Cause:** Wrong email credentials or App Password expired
**Solution:**
1. Verify App Password is correct
2. Generate new App Password if needed
3. Update `.env.local`
4. Restart dev server

#### Error: "Connection refused"
**Cause:** Can't connect to Gmail SMTP
**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Check firewall settings
3. Try using port 465 instead (requires code change)

#### Error: Network request failed
**Cause:** Dev server not running or wrong port
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev

# Check it's on port 3001 (or whatever port you're using)
```

## üîç Console Logs to Look For

### Successful Submission:

**Browser Console:**
```
Submitting nomination data: {
  nominatorFullName: "Test User",
  nominatorEmail: "test@example.com",
  ...
  nomineeProfilePicture: "1728027345688.jpg",
  nomineeProject: "policy-pol_68e4fefac67ede88c3865f09.pdf"
}

API Response: {
  message: "Nomination submitted successfully!"
}
```

**Server Terminal:**
```
=== Nomination API called ===
Request body received: { nominatorFullName: 'Test User', ... }
Creating email transporter...
Email transporter created successfully
Sending email to: Yasir@theboredroomx.com
Email sent successfully!
```

### Failed Submission:

**Browser Console:**
```
Error: Failed to submit nomination. Please try again.
API Error: { error: "...", details: "..." }
```

**Server Terminal:**
```
=== Error submitting nomination ===
Error details: Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 ...
Error message: Invalid login
Error stack: ...
```

## ‚ú® Summary

**What was fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ Added detailed logging for debugging
2. ‚úÖ Better error messages for users
3. ‚úÖ Validation of environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Detailed error tracking in API
5. ‚úÖ Console logs at every step

**What's working:**
- ‚úÖ Form validation
- ‚úÖ File name capture
- ‚úÖ Email sending (if credentials are correct)
- ‚úÖ Stripe payment opening
- ‚úÖ Modal closing after success

**Known Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Actual file content not uploaded (only file names sent)
- ‚ùå No file storage
- ‚ùå No email attachments

**To fully test:**
1. Make sure dev server is running
2. Fill out the form completely
3. Click "Submit & Pay"

## üÜò If Still Not Working

1. **Share the console logs** from both browser and server
2. **Check environment variables** are loaded correctly
3. **Try sending a test email** directly from the API route
4. **Verify Gmail App Password** is still valid
5. **Check if 2-Step Verification** is enabled on Gmail account
6. **Restart the dev server** to reload environment variables

The enhanced logging will now show exactly where the issue is occurring!
